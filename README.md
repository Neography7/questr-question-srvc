## Description

The Questions microservice, developed using Nest.js, manages core functionalities related to querying, handling, and providing answers to questions within the platform. It oversees tasks such as creating, retrieving, updating, and deleting questions, as well as supplying answers to questions.

This microservice collaborates closely with the User service, allowing seamless integration of user-related information alongside question-and-answer data. It relies on MongoDB for efficient data storage and retrieval concerning questions and their respective answers.

This microservice communicates with the api-gateway and other services via GRPC. 

## Technologies

- **Nest.js:** Employed for developing the microservice architecture.
- **MongoDB:** Utilized for database storage.
- **TypeORM:** Used as an ORM for database interactions.
- **gRPC:** Used for communication between microservices.
- **i18next:** Used for internationalization (i18n) support.
